\section*{Problem 1}

% Spiegare cosa mandiamo e come lo generiamo
In this problem the channel $q(n\frac{T}{4})$ is given at $T_c = \frac{T}{4}$. The goal is to estimate at the receiver the timing phase $t_0$ and the equivalent channel impulse response in $T$ with LS method.
The setting of the system is as in Fig.~\ref{fig:channel_T4}. In order to perform LS estimation the first $L + N_{seq} = 15 + 10$ symbols of the sequence $a_k$ are binary symbols out of a QPSK constellation with $\sigma_a^2 = 2$. 
In particular they are $1+j$ and $-1-j$ and map the $+1$ and $-1$ values of a ML sequence of length $L = 15$, partially repeated by $N_{seq}=10$. Then QPSK data follows. 
The conversion between a bit stream and QPSK is carried out by the \texttt{bitmap} function. %% TODO some more on this?? Give a better formulation

%%TODO Does Eq go in dB???? 

% Spiegare che channel_output funziona da polifase
The noisy output $r_n$ of the channel is computed with a polyphase version of the channel impulse response $q(nT_c)$. Each branch is $q^{i}(mT) = q(mT + i)$ with $i \in [0, 3]$ , and since it is not time-varying it is possible to directly compute the convolution of each branch and the $a_k$ sequence. At the output of each convolution white noise $w_n$ is added, with variance $\sigma_w^2 = \frac{\sigma_a^2 E_q}{4 \Gamma} = -19.2411$ dB, where $\sigma_a^2 = 2$, $E_q = 2.3819$ and $\Gamma = 20$ dB is the given SNR at receiver input. Then a parallel to series converter generates the output at time $T_c$.

% !!! Spiegare come stimiamo t0, riportare l'equazione (Formula 7.269, channel_estimator)
The first operation which the receiver does is estimating $t_0$ as optimal timing phase in $T_c$. In particular, given the stream of symbols $r_n$, and the knowledge of the ML sequence $a_l, l\in [0, L-1]$, the receiver computes

\begin{equation}
	m_{opt} = \argmax_m | x_{ra}(mT_c) | = \argmax_{m} | \frac{1}{L} \sum_{l = 0}^{L - 1} x(lT + mT_c)a^* (l) |
\end{equation}
for $ 0 < m < 40$ and finds that
\begin{equation}
	m_{opt} = 10
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
	t_{0} = m_{opt}T_c = 10 T_c
\end{equation}

% Spiegare differenza tra m_opt (in T/4, che Ã¨ t0), init_offs (in T/4) e delay (in T)
% Is it really useful? Michele
Remeber that $t_0 = 10$ in $T_c$ and the corresponding $D_{ch} = (t_0 \% 4)T = 2T$ represent the number of samples after which the receiver receives the first sample of the training sequence multiplied by $h_0$, which is the coefficient of the channel impulse response with the gratest amplitude. In other words, if the receiver and the transmitter use the same time index $k$ and if $x_k$ is the output at time $T$ of the receiver then
\begin{equation}
x_{k} = h_0a_{k-D_{ch}} + i_k, \quad i_k = \sum_{\substack{i = -N_1 \\ i \neq 0}}^{N_2} h_i a_{k-D_{ch}-i}
\end{equation}
where $i_k$ is the inter-symbol interference. Therefore, if $t_0 = 10T_c$ and $D_{ch} = 2T$ there could be at most 2 precursors (i.e. the coefficients of $h_i$ for $i = -N_1, \dots, -1$), and they can be equal to 0 (they don't introduce ISI but just the delay $D_{ch}$) or different from 0 but with an amplitude lower than $h_0$. 

The receiver can now the estimate of the channel impulse response at time $T$. The output of the channel $r_n$ is sampled at $n = t_0 + kT$ to get $x_k = r_{t_0 + kT}$. Then the LS estimate is computed using the symbols of the known ML sequence $a_k$ sent and a suitable section of the output. Note that the training sequence sent of lenght $L + N_{seq} = 25$ has $N_{seq} = 10$ which is enough to avoid the transient of the channel which is $N - 1$, with $N = N_1 + N_2 + 1$ which is the real length of the impulse response.
Note also that the LS method can estimate a causal impulse response, $\tilde{h}_j, j = 0, \dots, N$, while the channel impulse response could have some precursors which are different from 0, and therefore an anticausal component. In order to correctly estimate $h_i, i = -N_1, \dots, N_2$, given a supposed length $\hat{N} = \hat{N}_1 + \hat{N}_2 + 1$, LS considers $a_k, k = 0, \dots, L+\hat{N}-1$ and the output $x_k, k = D_{ch} - N_1, \dots, D_{ch} - N_1 + L + \hat{N} - 1$ and it performs the estimation in the standard way. This is the same as considering a causal impulse response, with $\hat{N}$ coefficients, but since we suppose that $N_1$ assumes a given value in $0, D_{ch}$, then it is possible to shift the estimate left of $N_1$ samples and obtain the estimate for $\hat{h}_i, i = -N_1, N_2$. 
The actual estimation is performed as in~\cite[p.~246]{bc}, i.e. using a $L \times \hat{N}$ observation matrix

\begin{equation}
	\boldsymbol{\mathcal{I}} =
 \begin{bmatrix}
  a(\hat{N}-1) & \cdots & a(0) \\
  \vdots  & \ddots & \vdots  \\
a[(\hat{N}-1)+(L-1)] & \cdots & a(L-1) \\
 \end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}
and a desired sample vector
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{o}^T = \left[ x(\hat{N}-1)\;,\; \ldots\; , \;x((\hat{N}-1)+(L-1)) \right].
\end{equation}
Therefore we can solve the LS problem as
\begin{equation}
	\hat{\mathbf{h}}= \mathbf{\Phi}^{-1} \boldsymbol{\vartheta}, \quad\mathrm{ with } \quad \mathbf{\Phi}=\boldsymbol{\mathcal{I}}^H \boldsymbol{\mathcal{I}} \quad \mathrm{ and }\quad \boldsymbol{\vartheta} = \boldsymbol{\mathcal{I}}^H \mathbf{o}.
\end{equation}

In particular, in order to estimate as first the length $\hat{N} = N_1 + N_2 + 1$ of the impulse response and $N_1, N_2$, we operate as follows. Let $N_{max} = N_{seq} = 10$ the maximum possible length $\hat{N}$ of the impulse response. As first, we set $N_1 = 0$ and compute the functional of the error 
\begin{equation} 
	\mathcal{E} = \frac{1}{L}\sum_{k = \hat{N} - 1}^{(L-1)+(\hat{N}-1)}|d(k)-\hat{d}(k)|^2
	\label{eq:functional}
\end{equation}
for $N_2 = 0, 1, \dots, N_{max} - N_1 - 1$. This procedure is repeated for $N_1 = 1$ and $2$. The functionals $\mathcal{E}$ for different $N_1$ are then plotted together, against $N_2$, in Fig.~\ref{fig:functional}.
\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width = 0.8\textwidth]{error_func_p1}
	\caption{$\mathcal{E}$ vs $N_2$ for different $N_1$}
	\label{fig:functional}
\end{figure}
It can be seen that there's a knee for $N_2 = 4 \forall N_1$, therefore we pick $N_2 = 4$. Then $N_1$ that minimizes $\mathcal{E}$ should be chosen, therefore $N_1 = 2$. However the 3 curves are very close to each other, and choosing $N_1 = 0$ would bring a similar functional $\mathcal{E}$ but a much lower complexity for Viterbi and FBA in the second problem. 

In Tables~\ref{table:h0} and~\ref{table:h2} are reported the amplitude and phase of $h_i, i = -N_1, \dots, N_2$, while in Fig.~\ref{fig:hi_p1} is reported the amplitude of both the choice $N_1 = 0$ and $N_1 = 2$. Note that they are very similar.

The noise that the channel introduces is $\sigma_w^2 = -19.2411$ dB, while the estimate $\hat{\sigma}_w^2 = something = -20.5327$ dB is lower (for the choice $N_1 = 0$, or $\hat{\sigma}_w^2 = -20.851$ for $N_1 = -2$). Note that this is the value given by a single estimate and not an expectation. However, this shows that a sequence of the given length $L = 15$ is too short to correctly estimate the real noise of the channel, since it averages on a number of noise samples which is close to the length of the impulse response we are trying to estimate. Indeed, by using a longer ML sequence (say 127) the estimate obtained is much closer to the real value also in each single realization.

At last, some considerations on the fact that the sequence used in this problem is a binary mapping in a QPSK constellation with $\sigma_a^2 = 2$ of a PN sequence. In particular let $a_l = (1+j) p_l$ with $p_l = \pm 1$ a symbol of the PN sequence. Then the autocorrelation of the sequence, of periodicity L, is
\begin{equation}
	r_a(n) = \frac{1}{L}\sum_{l = 0}^{L-1} a_l a^*_{l-n} = \\
	\frac{1}{L}\sum_{l = 0}^{L-1} (1+j)p_l (1-j)p^*_{l-n} = 
	\frac{2}{L} \sum_{l= 0}^{L-1} p_l p^*_{l-n} = 2 r_p(n)
\end{equation}
with 
\begin{equation}
	r_p(n) = 
  	\begin{cases}
    1       & \quad \text{if } n =0 \\
    -\frac{1}{L}  & \quad \text{if } n \neq 0 \\
  \end{cases}
\end{equation}
Therefore let $\Phi(i, n) = [\mathbf{\Phi}]_{i, n}$. Then
\begin{equation}
	\Phi(i, n) = (L -1 + N - N + 1)r_a(i-n) = 2Lr_p(i-n)
\end{equation}
At the same time $\vartheta(n) = 2Lr_{dp}(n)$ with $\boldsymbol{\vartheta} = [\vartheta(0), \dots, \vartheta(N-1)]$.
Therefore the LS can be solved in the usual way, as previously mentioned, with the equation $\hat{\mathbf{h}}= \mathbf{\Phi}^{-1} \boldsymbol{\vartheta}$ and provides the same soultion that a PN sequence would give. 
As for the signal-to-estimation error ratio, it is possible to procede as in \cite{bc}. Let $\boldsymbol{\vartheta} = \sum_{N-1}^{N-1+L-1} x(k) \mathbf{a}^*(k)$ and $\boldsymbol{\xi} = \sum_{N-1}^{N-1+L-1} w(k) \mathbf{x}*(k)$ we obtain $\boldsymbol{\vartheta} = \boldsymbol{\Phi}\mathbf{h} + \boldsymbol{\xi}$ and finally $\boldsymbol{\Delta h} = \boldsymbol{\Phi}^{-1} \boldsymbol{\xi}$.

\subsection*{Viterbi algorithm}

The Viterbi algorithm was implemented as a MATLAB function that performs the maximum likelihood detection using the whole message, including the known PN preamble for channel estimation, with initial conditions set to zero. Therefore, the initial conditions for the detection of the actual data (i.e. without the preamble) are given by the final symbols of the training sequence, which also has the function of training the Viterbi algorithm. The parameters $L_1 = 0$ and $L_2 = 4$ are set equal to $N_1$ and $N_2$ from problem 1.

The state of the FSM associated with the algorithm at time $k$ is as in \cite{bc}:
\begin{equation}
	\mathbf{s}_k = (a_{k+L1}, \ldots, a_{k-L_2+1}) = (a_k, \ldots, a_{k-3}), \quad k=0...K-1,
	\label{eq:state}
\end{equation}
where $K$ is the length of the input sequence, therefore the number of states is $N_S = M ^ {L_1 + L_2} = 4^4 = 256$. We associate each symbol of the QPSK constellation to an index $\alpha = 0,\ldots,3$ (the rule is arbitrary and it does not affect the result), so that a symbol $a_k$ at time $k$ is mapped to the corresponding index $\alpha_k$. The internal representation of the state is an integer in base $M$, with the most recent symbol in the least significant position, such that the state $\mathbf{s}_k$ is mapped to the integer
\begin{equation}
s_k = \sum_{i=0}^{L_1+L_2-1} M^i \alpha_{k+L_1-i} = \sum_{i=0}^{3} M^i \alpha_{k-i}.
\end{equation}
At time $k$, given the state $\mathbf{s}_{k-1}$ represented by $s_{k-1}$, and assuming the new symbol is $a_k$, the new state index is obtained by setting to 0 the two most significant bits (corresponding to the oldest symbol), shifting left by 2 bits and then adding the index of the new symbol in the two least significant bits:
\begin{equation}
s_k = \left[ (s_{k-1}) \lmod{M^{L_1+L_2-1}} \right] M + \alpha_k = 4 \, \left[ (s_{k-1})\lmod{64} \right] + \alpha_k.
\end{equation}
In our implementation, we check all possible transitions by cycling through all state indices $s_{k-1}$ and considering for each of them the $M=4$ new possible symbols. Let the sequence of new state indices $s_k$ defined with this double iteration be $\{ s_k^{(i)} \}_{i=0,\ldots,MN_S-1}$, that has length $MN_S = M^{L_1+L_2+1} = 1024$.  Then, we have
\begin{equation}
s_k^{(i)} = i \mod N_S,
\end{equation}
hence a simple way of defining the new state indices is initializing a counter to 0 and incrementing it at every iteration of the inner loop. In fact \ldots %TODO

Using the notation of \cite{bc}, we define $u_k$ as the desired received signal that carries information, that is the convolution of the sent symbol with the impulse response of the channel:
\begin{equation}
u_k = \sum_{n=-L_1}^{L_2} h_n a_{k-n} = \sum_{n=0}^{4} h_n a_{k-n}.
\label{eq:ukdefinition}\end{equation}
We observe that, given a fixed impulse response of the channel, $u_k$ only depends on the symbols $a_{k-4},\ldots, a_k$, which equivalent to say that it is a function of the current and the previous state, or of the current symbol and the previous state, i.e.
\begin{equation}
u_k = f_1(\mathbf{s}_{k-1}, \mathbf{s}_k) = f_2(\mathbf{s}_{k-1}, a_k) = f(s_{k-1}, \alpha_k),
\end{equation}
where $f$ has support $\{0,\ldots,N_S-1\} \times \{0,\ldots,M-1\}$. In the initialization phase of the algorithm, we build a $N_S \times M$ matrix, according to \eqref{eq:ukdefinition}, to be used during execution as a lookup table to determine the value of $u_k$ given the previous state and the current assumed received symbol. Note that in the first iterations $u_k$ depends on the initial conditions on $a$, that in our case were set to zero, therefore the lookup table is formally inaccurate. However, this transient error disappears completely before the end of the training sequence, thus the detection of the actual data is formally and practically correct.

At time $k$, for each possible previous state $\mathbf{s}_{k-1}$, the cost metric
\begin{equation}
\Gamma_k = \sum_{i=0}^k |\rho_i - u_i|^2
\end{equation}
is computed recursively as
\begin{equation}
\Gamma_k = \Gamma_{k-1} + |\rho_k - u_k|^2,
\end{equation}
where $\rho_k$ is the observed sample at time $k$ and $\Gamma_{k-1}$ is the cost metric of the assumed state $\mathbf{s}_{k-1}$. The 4 possible values of $u_k$ are given by row $s_{k-1}$ of the lookup table, yielding 4 different values of $\Gamma_k$ according to the new symbol $a_k$. These 4 values of $\Gamma_k$ are always associated to different states $\mathbf{s}_k$, and each of the new states $\mathbf{s}_k$ has 4 values of $\Gamma_k$ depending on the transition the system used to get to this state. Instead of storing all $MN_S$ values of $\Gamma_k$, we only keep track of the lowest $\Gamma_k$ for each new state $\mathbf{s}_k$, and we record the predecessor $\mathbf{s}_{k-1}$ (by means of its index $s_{k-1}$) that yielded the lowest cost. Finally, we make the decision on the oldest symbol of the survivor sequences according to the cost metric $\Gamma_k$, and we store the new survivor sequences with the respective costs.
%TODO use notation \Gamma(\mathbf{s}_k) ?

The survivor sequences at time $k$ are stored as symbols of the constellation, i.e. $a_{k-K_d} \ldots,a_{k-1}$, and the symbol $a_{k-K_d}$ is decided at the end of the $k$-th iteration. Therefore the Viterbi algorithm has a finite memory, that is the length $K_d$ of the trellis diagram, also known as trellis depth. It may happen that at time $k$ the symbols $a_{k-K_d}$ of all survivor sequences are the same, which means that the $(k-K_d)$-th symbol, and the previous ones, are already fixed: there is no point in keeping them in the survivor sequences, so we discard them and store the correct symbol in the vector of decided data. On the other hand, if the symbols $a_{k-K_d}$ of the survivor sequences are different then we are deciding based on the path metric up until $k$ (that is $\Gamma_k$), whereas we should decide the whole sequence according to the path metric computed on the whole message. This is an approximation that can in general yield some inaccuracies in the detection. The goal is to minimize $K_d$ for efficiency, without affecting too much the results.

We run 16 simulations of the transmission of 3 ML sequences with length $2^{20} - 1$ over our channel, with the setup used for all experiments of problem 2, and a Viterbi detector with $K_d = 80$. At each iteration (starting after the transient $K_d$), the modified Viterbi detector checks which is the minimum value of $K_d$ that would yield no premature decision. In other words, all survivor sequences contain the same symbols from a certain column backwards, and that column is given by the minimum $K_d$ needed.

Finally, we average the results of all experiments to obtain a complementary CDF for the minimum $K_d$. If the resulting complementary CDF is $y$ for a certain value of $K_d$, it means that for that $K_d$ the number of iterations in which the decision on the oldest symbol is actually made among different symbols is $y$ times the total number of iterations (except for the transient during which the survivor sequence is filled for the first time). In those cases, the symbol that belongs to the most likely sequence is chosen, which might turn out to be a suboptimal decision. The number of times we make this approximation on the Viterbi algorithm is $y$ times the length of the sequence.

The complementary CDF we get is shown in Fig.~\ref{}, from which we chose $K_d = 28$, that yields a probability of at most $7\cdot 10^{-7}$ that the first column of the matrix has different symbols. Therefore, the probability of making a wrong choice due to this approximation cannot be more than $7\cdot 10^{-7}$, which is reasonable unless we are trying to measure SNR's on that order of magnitude.

\subsection*{Max-Log-MAP}
Using the maximum a posteriori probability (MAP) criterion, the decision upon a received symbol is performed according to the expression:
\begin{equation}
	\hat{\boldsymbol{a}} = \argmax_{\boldsymbol{\alpha}} P[\boldsymbol{a} = \boldsymbol{\alpha} | \boldsymbol{z} = \boldsymbol{\rho}]
\end{equation}
If we introduce the \emph{likelihood function}:
\begin{equation}
	\mathtt{L}_k(\beta) = P[a_{k+L_1} = \beta | \mathbf{z}_0^{K-1} = \boldsymbol{\rho}_0^{K-1}]
\end{equation}
the criterion becomes:
\begin{equation}
	\hat{a}_{k+L1} = \argmax_{\beta \in \mathcal{A}} \mathtt{L}_k(\beta)
\end{equation}
In order to solve the problem of the likelihood function maximization, the FBA algorithm can be used. The algorithm performs the computation of four metrics, namely:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Forward metric, $F_k(j)$
	\item Backward metric, $B_k(j)$
	\item State metric, $V_k(j)$
	\item Likelihood function of the generic symbol,
	\begin{equation}
	 	\mathtt{L}_k(j) = \sum_{\substack{i = 1 \\ [\boldsymbol{\sigma}_i]_1 = \beta}}^{N_S} V_k(i) \quad \beta \in \mathcal{A}
	 \end{equation} 
\end{itemize}
where k is the variable associated with the symbol index and j is the state index, as defined in the Viterbi algorithm (Eq.~\ref{eq:state}).

Applying the logarithm to the above metrics yields the \emph{log-likelihood} function, whose expression is 
\begin{equation}
	\ell_k(\beta) = \ln \mathtt{L}_k(\beta) = \ln \sum_{\substack{i = 1 \\ [\boldsymbol{\sigma}_i]_1 = \beta}}^{N_S} e^{v_k(i)} \quad \beta \in \mathcal{A}
\end{equation}
where $v_k(i) = \ln V_k(i)$ is the logarithm of the state metric.

Using the logarithm the difference between the state metrics is enhanced, and as a result one term usually dominates within each time index $k$ in the sum above. Therefore, we can introduce the Max-Log-MAP criterion:
\begin{equation}
	\hat{a}_{k+L1} = \argmax_{\beta \in \mathcal{A}} \tilde{\ell}_k(\beta)
\end{equation}
where we use the approximation 
\begin{equation}
	\tilde{\ell}_k(\beta) = \max_{\substack{i \in [1, \dots, N_S] \\ [\boldsymbol{\sigma}_i]_1 = \beta}} v_k(i)
\end{equation}
