\section*{Problem 1}

\subsection*{Choice of $N_h$}

In order to determine a suitable length $N_h$ of the impulse response, we consider the noise that we would introduce by performing the truncation of the power delay profile (that corresponds to a truncation of the random impulse response). The given discrete power delay profile of the channel is a sampled version of
$$ \M(\tau) = \frac{1}{\bar{\tau}_{rms}} e^{-\tau / \bar{\tau}_{rms}} $$
that is
$$ \M(iT_C) = \frac{1}{\bar{\tau}_{rms}} e^{-iT_C / \bar{\tau}_{rms}} $$
with $i$ non-negative integer and $T_C = 1$. This quantity must be then normalized in such a way that
$$\sum_{i=0}^{\infty} \M(iT_C) = 1 - C^2 $$
where $C = \sqrt{K / (K+1)}$ is the deterministic component of the first ray (for $i=0$) and $K$ is the Rice factor. Note that we are considering an infinite number of rays, but as a matter of fact MATLAB approximates as zero all values $\M(iT_C)$ for $i > 894$, therefore we stop the summation to 894 (actually 899, LOL). % TODO Do not forget to fix this

Knowing that the true impulse response of the channel has random properties described by the power delay profile $\M(iT_C)$ and by the quantity $C$, then we define the quality of the approximation due to truncation as
$$ \Lambda_t(N_h) = \frac{E[||\mathbf{h}||^2]}{E[||\mathbf{\Delta h}||^2]} = \frac{C^2 + \sum_{i=0}^{\infty} \M(iT_C)}{\sum_{i=N_h}^{\infty} \M(iT_C)} $$
where $\mathbf{h}$ is the vector of the impulse response $[h_0(nT_C),~h_1(nT_C),\ldots]$ and therefore
$$ E[||\mathbf{h}||^2] = E[\sum_{i=0}^{\infty} |h_i(nT_C)|^2] = C^2 + \sum_{i=0}^{\infty} \M(iT_C). $$
The noise in the system is
$$ \Lambda = \frac{\M_x E[||\mathbf{h}||^2]}{4 \sigma_w^2} = \frac{\M_x (C^2 + \sum_{i=0}^{\infty} \M(iT_C))}{4 \sigma_w^2} $$
where $\M_x$ is the statistical power of the input signal. Finally, we define the normalized ratio
$$ \Lambda_n (N_h) = \frac{\Lambda_t}{\Lambda} = \frac{4 \sigma_w^2}{\M_x \sum_{i=N_h}^{\infty} \M(iT_C)} $$
to compare the noise of the system with the noise we are introducing by truncating $\M(iT_C)$ to $N_h$ samples.

Looking at the plot of $\Lambda_n (N_h)_{\dB}$ against $N_h$ in Fig.~\ref{fig:p01_lambda_n}, we can maintain that $N_h = 3$ is a good choice, since we have $\Lambda_n(2) \approx 2~\dB$ and $\Lambda_n(3) \approx 5.6~\dB$.

\section*{Problem 2}

\subsection*{Setup of the receiver}
% TODO
Draw the polyphase implementation of the channel. This will help clarify what N_i and N are.

At the receiver side, the LS method is used in order to estimate the impulse response of the channel. A known ML pseudo-noise sequence $x(kT)$ of length L + N - 1 is sent through the channel. In its polyphase implementation, the channel is a sequence of 4 parallel filters with common input. In order to go from the T to the Tc sampling times, these branches are followed by a parallel/series switch that selects the outputs of the filters, passing to the next branch every Tc seconds. This yields an output signal $d(kTc)$ at the receiver side, using which the receiver now has to estimate the coefficients $h_i$ by $\hat(h_i)$.

\subsection*{Determine $L$ and $N$}
\subsection*{Estimate of $E[||\mathbf{\hat{h}}-\mathbf{h}||^2]$ assuming $\mathbf{h}$ is known}

\subsection*{Comparing the estimate of $E[||\mathbf{\hat{h}}-\mathbf{h}||^2]$ with its theoretical value}

We can now give a theoretical value of the estimation error yielded by this implementation of the LS method. It is the average error on the estimate of the impulse response $\mathbf{h}$ if we assume that we are using $N$ coefficients, $L$ input samples of the ML sequence, and that $N=N_h$. With $L$ fixed, this estimation error becomes worse as $N$ increases, but of course this holds for $N=N_h$ only, otherwise this result does not apply. In fact, when estimating $\mathbf{h}$ with $N>N_h$ we are somehow wasting coefficients, and the estimate gets worse because of the noise in the system. On the other hand, the actual error becomes even larger if $N<N_h$ since we have less degrees of freedom with respect to the ones of the system.

Formally, the estimation error is given by
$$ E[||\mathbf{\hat{h}}-\mathbf{h}||^2] = E[||\mathbf{\Delta h}||^2] = E[\sum_{i=0}^{3} ||\mathbf{\Delta h}_i||^2] = \sum_{i=0}^{3} E[||\mathbf{\Delta h}_i||^2]$$
where we split the formula according to the 4 branches of the polyphase implementation. Following the rationale presented in \cite{bc}, for each branch with index $i=0,\ldots,3$ we get
$$\mathbf{\Phi}_i^{-1} = \frac{1}{L+1} \left( \mathbf{I} + \frac{\mathbf{1}_{N_i \times N_i}}{L+1-N_i} \right)$$
where $\mathbf{1}_{N_i \times N_i}$ is the $N_i \times N_i$ matrix with all elements equal to $1$, and therefore
$$ \tr [\mathbf{\Phi}_i^{-1}] = \frac{N_i(L+2-N_i)}{(L+1)(L+1-N_i)}. $$
Finally, we can express the estimation error of the $i$-th branch as
$$ E[||\mathbf{\Delta h}_i||^2] = \sigma_w^2 \; \tr [(\mathbf{\Phi}_i^*)^{-1}] = \sigma_w^2 \; \tr [\mathbf{\Phi}_i^{-1}] = \sigma_w^2 \frac{N_i(L+2-N_i)}{(L+1)(L+1-N_i)}$$
where $\mathbf{\Phi}_i$ is Hermitian. Going back to the overall estimation error we have
$$ E[||\mathbf{\hat{h}}-\mathbf{h}||^2] = \sum_{i=0}^{3} E[||\mathbf{\Delta h}_i||^2] = \frac{\sigma_w^2}{L+1} \sum_{i=0}^{3} \frac{N_i (L+2-N_i)}{L+1-N_i}.$$

TODO: considerations on when this formula (and the one on the book with one branch only) holds.

NB: non si e' detto nulla su $N_i$ perche' ne parleremo nei punti precenti.
